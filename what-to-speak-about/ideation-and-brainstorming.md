# Ideation & Brainstorming

There are lots of ways to come up with a talk proposal. In my personal experience, I find that I write better talks when I stumble upon a cool insight and think, "Hey, this story would make for a cool tech talk!",
then keeping an eye on Calls for Papers to find a conference where that proposal might fit. In contrast, deciding that I really want to attend a certain conference,
then trying to come up with a topic for it, has generally worked less well for me, perhaps because my core motivation isn't necessarily wanting to share a story.

## Techniques

#### "Novices, Peers, Nobody Yet"

This is an exercise I developed at Pivotal to help people discover potential collaborators on topics they were mutually interested in presenting.

You will need:

* Wall or whiteboard space
* Post-it notes in three colors: red, yellow, green
* Pens

1. Hand out pens and post-its so that each person has at least 3-5 post-its of each color.
1. Prompt the room: *What are some topics that you would feel comfortable talking about, to a room full of folks who were brand new to the topic?* Write these ideas down on yellow post-its, and put your initials in the corner of each post-it.
1. Set a timer to no more than 3 minutes. If there are more than 5 participants, consider capping the number of post-its to 3 per person. At the end of 3 minutes, ask everyone to stop writing, but keep their post-its.
1. Prompt the room again: *What are some topics that you would feel comfortable talking about, to a room full of people who are pretty knowledgeable about the topic?* Repeat previous two steps, but with green post-its.
1. Prompt the room once again: *What are some topics that you want to present about, but you wouldn't feel comfortable presenting to ANYONE yet?* Repeat, with red post-its.
1. Ask folks to stick up their post-its, and try to thematically group them as best as they can.

You will likely see a few large topic clusters, ie. "Infrastructure", "DevOps", "Process Change", "Testing".

Choose 2-3 of the largest clusters, or more depending on how many participants you have. Ask someone who perhaps has a lot of green post-its in that cluster to be a small group leader.

Once leaders are designated for the main clusters, ask the rest of participants to self-organise into small groups. Prompt each of the small groups: *Within this broad topic area, what are some talks that you'd like to see?* Encourage them to give each other feedback, even on vague notions.

The rest of the session usually doesn't need too much facilitation. You don't have to pressure the clusters
to generate any concrete output: participants will most likely get a lot of value from learning that there are other folks who want to talk about things they're interested in.
You may want to encourage collaboration between folks who submitted green stickies and those who submitted pink stickies on similar topics.

Take a picture of the post-it wall: because it will look awesome, and it will also remind people later on that there is a wide range of topics within reach!
