## Welcome!

This is a collection of resources, by myself and others, that are focused on improving technical speaking skills.

## Components of delivering a technical talk

Becoming a strong technical presenter involves a few discrete skills: public speaking, being able to break down complicated technical concepts, visual design, writing, and more!

This can seem overwhelming. But recognizing this fact is the key to creating an achievable set of goals. You can work on these skills separately, and you will be able to feel real improvement if you focus on small surface areas to work on, in small increments.

This project is very much a work in progress. Feedback is welcome - either open an issue here, or email me at hi@deniseyu.io.

Focal areas are grouped under themes, and headers are somewhat linear -- but this is intended to be more of an encyclopedia than a how-to manual.
